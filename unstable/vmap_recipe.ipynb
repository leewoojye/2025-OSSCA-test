        "# torch.vmap\n\nThis tutorial introduces torch.vmap, an autovectorizer for PyTorch\noperations. torch.vmap is a prototype feature and cannot handle a number\nof use cases; however, we would like to gather use cases for it to\ninform the design. If you are considering using torch.vmap or think it\nwould be really cool for something, please contact us at\n<https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/42368>.\n\n## So, what is vmap?\n\nvmap is a higher-order function. It accepts a function\n[func]{.title-ref} and returns a new function that maps\n[func]{.title-ref} over some dimension of the inputs. It is highly\ninspired by JAX\\'s vmap.\n\nSemantically, vmap pushes the \\\"map\\\" into PyTorch operations called by\n[func]{.title-ref}, effectively vectorizing those operations.\n"

One can write a function [func]{.title-ref}\nthat runs on examples and then lift it to a function that can take\nbatches of examples with [vmap(func)]{.title-ref}. [func]{.title-ref}\nhowever is subject to many restrictions:\n\n-   it must be functional (one cannot mutate a Python data structure\n    inside of it), with the exception of in-place PyTorch operations.\n-   batches of examples must be provided as Tensors. This means that\n    vmap doesn\\'t handle variable-length sequences out of the box.\n\nOne example of using [vmap]{.title-ref} is to compute batched dot\nproducts. PyTorch doesn\\'t provide a batched [torch.dot]{.title-ref}\nAPI; instead of unsuccessfully rummaging through docs, use\n[vmap]{.title-ref} to construct a new function:\n"
